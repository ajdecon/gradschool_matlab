Find here miscellaneous Matlab scripts I've written over the past few years 
to analyze the data I've worked with in the Lewis group.  The majority
of these files are poorly named, badly commented, and not at all organized.
I'm archiving them here and hoping that I can get them organized sometime...
especially as Steve will probably need to make some sense of them.

The majority of what's here pertains to doing particle tracking on 
images of colloidal rods, and calculating things like their MSD.
There's also some code in here for working with images of various other
interesting soft materials.

Nearly everything in this is dependent on the Matlab Image Processing 
Toolbox.
